Twitter Tinker
Allows user to enter two twitter usernames, randomly generates a tweet, and has user guess which twitter profile it belongs to. At the end, tallies correct responses.
All required dependencies are added. Only thing required is an IDE that runs Python.

Fun part of readme unique to project:
Hi! I deciced to include this file to talk a little about my project and why I decided to go about it the way that I did.
While I certainly have the most experience with Swift and some experience with dealing with JSON data, I wanted to do something that I could get done
despite some technical difficulties I ran into that would still push me out of the comfort zone.

I) My poor computer, may it rest in peace.
On Friday afternoon I got back to my dorm room and placed my backpack with my laptop in it on my desk chair. My backpack fell over, and it landed with the side of
my computer against the floor, cracking the display and the screen to the point where it was unusable. With COVID and the closure of Apple stores in Tennesseee, 
it was the most time-sensitive manner considering I am a CS major in 2201 ;( involved getting a new laptop delivered by Tuesday.

II) Working on the project
Once I got my laptop, I had a midterm to prepare for, after which I got started on the project. I decided to work with python, because it seemed like a happy
medium between things I've done before and yet still enough of a challenge. I used tweepy because it was a cool resource I really wanted to take advantage of. 
One thing I did notice is that the 450 request limit for app tweets kicked in before I could collect 3200, but besides that it works well!

III) Running the project
I coded in pycharm, and it worked great there. My project does allow you to put in two existing tweet names, and my suggestion is @dawn_altea (she's an amazing
friend of mine and her tweets made me crack up multiple times late last night). They're amazing!
